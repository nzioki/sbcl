;;;; COMPARE-AND-SWAP
;;;;
;;;; SB-EXT:COMPARE-AND-SWAP is the public API for now.
;;;;
;;;; Internally our interface has CAS, GET-CAS-EXPANSION, DEFINE-CAS-EXPANDER,
;;;; DEFCAS, and #'(CAS ...) functions -- making things mostly isomorphic with
;;;; SETF.

;;; This is what it all comes down to.
(def!macro cas (place old new &environment env)
  #!+sb-doc
  "Synonym for COMPARE-AND-SWAP.

Additionally DEFUN, DEFGENERIC, DEFMETHOD, FLET, and LABELS can be also used to
define CAS-functions analogously to SETF-functions:

  (defvar *foo* nil)

  (defun (cas foo) (old new)
    (cas (symbol-value '*foo*) old new))

First argument of a CAS function is the expected old value, and the second
argument of is the new value. Note that the system provides no automatic
atomicity for CAS functions, nor can it verify that they are atomic: it is up
to the implementor of a CAS function to ensure its atomicity.

EXPERIMENTAL: Interface subject to change."

  "Atomically stores NEW in PLACE if OLD matches the current value of PLACE.
Two values are considered to match if they are EQ. Returns the previous value

PLACE must be an CAS-able place. Built-in CAS-able places are accessor forms
whose CAR is one of the following:

 CAR, CDR, FIRST, REST, SVREF, SYMBOL-PLIST, SYMBOL-VALUE, SVREF, SLOT-VALUE
 SB-MOP:STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS, SB-MOP:FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS,

or the name of a DEFSTRUCT created accessor for a slot whose declared type is
either FIXNUM or T. Results are unspecified if the slot has a declared type
other then FIXNUM or T.

In case of SLOT-VALUE, if the slot is unbound, SLOT-UNBOUND is called unless
OLD is EQ to SB-PCL:+SLOT-UNBOUND+ in which case SB-PCL:+SLOT-UNBOUND+ is
returned and NEW is assigned to the slot. Additionally, the results are
unspecified if there is an applicable method on either
SB-MOP:SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS, (SETF SB-MOP:SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS), or
SB-MOP:SLOT-BOUNDP-USING-CLASS.

Additionally, the PLACE can be a anything for which a CAS-expansion has been
specified using DEFCAS, DEFINE-CAS-EXPANDER, or for which a CAS-function has
been defined. (See SB-EXT:CAS for more information.)
